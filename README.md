# Visual Field Tokenization: Vector Quantization and Gumbel-Softmax Implementations

This repository contains two implementations for tokenizing visual field data using:
1. **Vector Quantization (KMeans Clustering)**
2. **Gumbel-Softmax Sampling**

Both methods are designed to convert continuous data into discrete representations suitable for machine learning tasks.
